                part of our site without notice. We will not be liable to you if for any reason our site is unavailable
                at any time or for any period. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have
                access to our site. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access our site through
                your internet connection are aware of these terms of use and other applicable terms and conditions, and
                that they comply with them.<br />Acceptable use<br />- You may use our site only for lawful purposes.
                You may not use our site:<br />- In any way that breaches any applicable local, national or
                international law or regulation.<br />- In any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful
                or fraudulent purpose or effect.<br />- For the purpose of harming or attempting to harm minors in any
                way.<br />- To send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not
                comply with our content standards.<br />- To transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or
                unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam).<br />-
                To knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms,
                time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code
                designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or hardware.<br />You also agree:<br />-
                Not to reproduce, duplicate, copy or re-sell any part of our site in contravention of these terms of
                use.<br />- Not to access without authority, interfere with, damage or disrupt any part of our site, any
                equipment or network on which our site is stored, any software used in the provision of our site or any
                equipment or network or software owned or used by any third party.<br />Interactive services - We may
                from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation, chat rooms,
                bulletin boards and blogs (&#34;interactive services&#34;).Where we do provide any interactive service,
                we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what
                form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical). Where we do moderate an
                interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a
                concern or difficulty arise.<br />We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in
                particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site,
                and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service
                (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no
                obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we
                expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service
                by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.<br />The
                use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian.
                We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they
                communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who
                are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.<br />Content
                Standards - These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our site
                (&#34;contributions&#34;), and to any interactive services associated with it. You must comply with the
                spirit and the letter of the following standards. The standards apply to each part of any contribution
                as well as to its whole. You warrant that any such contribution does comply with the standards listed
                below, and you will be liable to us and indemnify us for any breach of this warranty.<br />Contributions
                must be accurate (where they state facts), be genuinely held (where they state opinions) and comply with
                applicable law in the UK and in any country from which they are posted.<br />Contributions must not:<br />-
                Contain any material which is defamatory of any person.<br />- Contain any material which is obscene,
                offensive, hateful or inflammatory.<br />- Promote sexually explicit material.<br />- Promote
                violence.<br />- Promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual
                orientation or age.<br />- Infringe any copyright, database right or trade mark of any other person.<br />-

                comply with any of the provisions of these terms of use. If you have any concerns regarding your user
                identification code or password or become aware of any misuse then you must inform us immediately.<br />Ownership
