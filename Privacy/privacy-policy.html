              charge a reasonable fee for additional copies. Your right to rectification. If we hold any inaccurate

              waiting for that objection to be verified. Where processing has been restricted for one of these reasons,

              consent; in relation to a legal claim; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
              person; or for reasons of important public interest. Your right to object to processing. You can object to
              us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only as far as our
              legal basis for the processing is that it is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the
              public interest, or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of our
              legitimate interests or those of a third party. If you make an objection, we will stop processing your
              personal information unless we are able to: demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing,
              and that these legitimate grounds override your interests, rights and freedoms; or the processing is in
              relation to a legal claim. Your right to object to direct marketing. You can object to us processing your

              However, you may not have this right if it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

              data protection laws, you can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
              protection. You may do this in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the
              place of the alleged infringement. Right to withdraw consent. To the extent that the legal basis we are
              relying on for processing your personal data is consent, you are entitled to withdraw that consent at any
              time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. Exercising your
